# Customer Order Service API

This project is a backend service for managing customers and orders, developed as part of a technical challenge. It is built with Python and Django, using Django REST Framework to provide RESTful API endpoints. The service handles customer data, order entries, and includes SMS notifications using Africa’s Talking API. Authentication is implemented via OpenID Connect.

## Features

- Manage customers and orders with a PostgreSQL-backed database
- RESTful API with Django REST Framework
- Authentication and authorization with OpenID Connect
- SMS notifications for new orders via Africa's Talking
- Automated testing with CI/CD pipeline

## Technologies Used

- **Python** and **Django** for backend logic
- **Django REST Framework** for API development
- **PostgreSQL** as the relational database
- **Africa’s Talking API** for SMS notifications
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- Africa’s Talking API account (for SMS service)
- OpenID Connect provider for authentication

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-order-service.git
   cd customer-order-service
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL database:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and update the database settings in `settings.py`.

5. **Apply migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name
DATABASE_USER=your_db_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_HOST=your_db_host
AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=your_africas_talking_username
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=your_africas_talking_api_key
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID=your_openid_client_id
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_openid_client_secret
```

## Usage

With the server running, use an API client like Postman to interact with the API. You can also use Django’s browsable API by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.

## Endpoints

- **Customer Endpoints**
  - `GET /customers/`: List all customers
  - `POST /customers/`: Create a new customer
  - `GET /customers/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific customer
  - `PUT /customers/<id>/`: Update a specific customer
  - `DELETE /customers/<id>/`: Delete a specific customer

- **Order Endpoints**
  - `GET /orders/`: List all orders
  - `POST /orders/`: Create a new order
  - `GET /orders/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific order
  - `PUT /orders/<id>/`: Update a specific order
  - `DELETE /orders/<id>/`: Delete a specific order

## Testing

To run tests:

1. Install test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-django
   ```

2. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```
